(for explore audio works on chrome not safari (asked Jonathan Yin during tutor hours and he said this is okay))

1) I dont think I would use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging
application because this woukd require another user to see if they recieved the message.
This isn't really debugging on a small scale and with unit tests you cannot test how the 
individual components interact with each other on an feature level, so I am not sure if a 
unit test would be appropriate for this.

2) Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature because to test this 
it doesn't require any other components. We are able to test this indiviudally, and this would be considered small-scale debugging.
